%% The NPS template readily supports two methods of generating list of acronyms.


%%
%% Option 1 - Powerful list of acronyms
%% ========
%% On the first line below, the longest acronym is placed in the 
%% square brackets.  This is used to size the column of the table 
%% correctly.
%%
\begin{acronym}[XXXXXXX] % longest acronym in these square brackets
\acro{DoD}{Department of Defense}
\acro{MASINT}{measurement and signature intelligence}
\acro{NPS}{Naval Postgraduate School}
\acro{SRWBR}{short range wide band radio}
\acro{US}{United States}
\acro{TCP}{Transmission Control Protocol}
\acro{UDP}{User Datagram Protocol}
\acro{USG}{United States government}
\end{acronym}

%% Using documentclass[acronym,...]
%% --------------------------------
%% If you include the 'acronym' package in the documentclass[] options
%% of the NPS template, it will only print items in this acro list that are
%% actually used in your paper.  In this manner, your acronym list will always
%% be up to date.  You can then reuse this acronyms.tex in other documents
%% as you continue to expand your acronyms in use.
%%
%% If you don't include the 'acronym' package explicitly, the package is
%% auto-included by the NPS Thesis Template, but all the acro{} entries
%% will be put into your thesis, whether you actually use them or not.
%%
%% Using the macros:
%% ----------------
%% It will track the usage of acronyms and uses the long form on their
%% first use.  This ensures consistency throughout your document even
%% in different revisions of your document. Your writing is also more portable.
%%
%% To use your acronym in a paragraph use \ac{shortname} or \acplural{shortname}
%% \acp{shortname} for plural shorthand.
%% Ex:  The \ac{FFT2} is performed on the data. 
%% The \acplural{FFT2} are efficient.
%% This command is how LaTeX tracks their usage.
%%
%% Using documentclass[acronym,index,...]
%% --------------------------------------
%% You may want to use this:
%%   \newcommand{\FFT2}{\ac{FFT2}\index{fast Fourier Transform}\xspace}
%% to save some time and typing.  Then you can do:
%% Ex: The \FFT2 is performed on the data.
%% The acronym will be used correctly, and the index will contain the 
%% use of the keyword. 
%%
%% The command's \xspace ensures that the spacing after the word is
%% handled correctly (ie, last word of a sentence gets a period on 
%% the word).


%%
%% Option 2 - Build your own list of acronyms
%% =========

%% With this option, you are responsible to write out the long form on the
%% first use, then you can simply use the acronym in your paragraphs that
%% follow.  This can become cumbersome during revisions to your thesis
%% because it is your responsibility to know if the acronym has been used yet.

%% The spacing with this option is wonky. It is no longer supported or reviewed.
