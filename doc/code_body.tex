The preferred way of organizing your thesis is into multiple files, linked together via the |input| command. 
It is generally unwise to use names like |chapter6.tex| and |appendix1.tex| as, at the time of writing, it
may not even be known if you are writing Chapter 6 or something that will become Chapter 7.
We suggest you give each files a name based on its content, like |survey.tex|, rather than suggesting on organizational
structure, like |chapter5.tex|. This will allow you to re-organize your material without
needing to re-name files, or otherwise becomming rather confused (\eg having Chapter 5 be the result of typesetting |chapter4.tex|).
