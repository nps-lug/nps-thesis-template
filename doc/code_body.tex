The preferred way of organizing your thesis is into multiple files, linked together via the |input| command. 
It is generally unwise to use names like |chapter1.tex| and |appendix1.tex| as, at the time of writing, it
may not even be known if you are writing Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.
We suggest you give the file names based on the content, like |survey.tex|, rather than based on organizational
structure, like |chapter5.tex|. This will allow you to re-organize the ordering of sections and chapters without
getting confused.
