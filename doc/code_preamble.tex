\subsection{Document Class Options}\label{sec:documentclass}
The \verb|documentclass| command (see Section~\ref{sec:prologue}, Line~\ref{code:documentclass}) 
specifies that the document uses the |npsreport.cls|
  file and all settings contained therein.  There are  several optional
  parameters, each separated by comma: 
  \begin{description}
    \item[article, thesis, or dissertation] choose the appropriate one 
    for the case.
    \item[12pt, 11pt, or 10pt] Font size selection.  With no option given, 12pt is the default.
    \item[times, arial, or courier]  Font selection.  With no option given, times is the default.
    \item[twoauthors, threeauthors, or fourauthors] use these options if you have 
    several authors.  Single authors need no option. 
    \item[twoadvisors] if you have two advisors rather than a second reader. 
    \item[fivemembers,advisoralone] dissertations by default have six committee members. 
    If you have only five members, use the |fivemembers| option; if you want the fifth member
    to be centered on the final line alone (which looks rather nice and symmetric), use the |advisorsalone| option.
    \item[twoside] prints on both sides of the same sheet of paper; recommended.
    \item[classified] if you are using an approved computer system to 
    write your thesis on sensitive research.
    \item[index] if you are including a keyword index page of your 
    thesis important terms.
    \item[acronym] for a more sophisticated handling of acronyms.  See 
    |acronyms.tex| for additional information.
    \item[traditional] prints the thesis in the style of the NPS
      Microsoft Word thesis template. Although you are free to use
      this style, the newer style is approved and looks quite nice 
    when no option is given.
    \item[singlespace] if you prefer single-spaced paragraphs, though it 
    may be a little harder to read. This is not approved for an NPS
    Masters Thesis, but is approved for NPS technical reports.
  \end{description}

\subsection{Multiple Authors and Multiple Advisors}
The template supports a variety of options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two authors
\item One advisor and one second reader
\item Two co-advisors
\item One advisor and one co-advisor and one second reader
\item \etc
\end{itemize}
Each of these require extra macros. See examples for populating the appropriate macros.
